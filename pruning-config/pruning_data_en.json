      "Drone-based pesticide spraying uses GPS and image recognition to pinpoint spray only where needed, reducing pesticide use by 30-50%.",
      "Image analysis AI enables early detection of pests and diseases, grasp of crop growth status, and prediction of optimal harvest timing, realizing improved yield and quality stabilization.",
      "These technologies allow even inexperienced new farmers to achieve yields and quality equal to or better than veteran farmers, lowering barriers to agricultural entry.",
      "Also, introduction of power assist suits and robot agricultural machinery can significantly reduce physical burden on aging agricultural workers.",
      "Future expectations include realization of fully automated farms using 5G communication and wide-area growth management using satellite data, with further technological innovation expected."
